##Multicat Clicker Knockout.js App
============================

A very basic clicker web app / game where you click on a cat picture and it counts your clicks. You can switch between different cats in the game.

Built as a learning exercise in MVC framework (Knockout.js) fundamentals. Takes in raw data of cats to instantiate, creates cat instances for each, and populates the UI accordingly. Tracks data for each cat in the model and syncs updates using observables, computed observables, and observable arrays. Generates DOM elements with some control structures.

Very basic CSS styling inlined in the head since it's relatively small so we can save an extra resource request.
